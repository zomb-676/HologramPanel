In most cases, holograms will be displayed triggered by a system called `popup`, you can configure it in the config screen

Then, you can quickly obtain information from it and do more than mods like `The one probe.`    
We can get the information in a more interactive way

Get the detailed item information that is stored just by your view

queue and store items conveniently without opening the container

If you think the widget is too big or too small, you can adjust its size conveniently, just by holding `alt` and scrolling your mouse.
Also, you can hold shift at the same time to adjust in a more precise way

Also, support for entity and support collapse the information, which takes too much space

In addition to holograms followed by the source and displayed on screen, there are also two other kinds of display types

Press `I` on them will pin them on the screen with an additional prompt line, useful for nearby entities like players or pets
![screen_pin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3ca5749-8296-4e8e-a1a6-c1b2cef3d27a)

Press `O` on them will pin them on level with a fixed direction and position  
You can adjust them easily, still without any GUI  
Press `B` to call the `CycleSelector` then select the one you want to modify  
Press your mouse button with `x`, `y` or `z`, then it will move along that axis
