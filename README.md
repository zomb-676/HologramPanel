Hologram Panel is a mod that is intended to provide a hover panel that displays useful information and supports some direct interaction  
Also, it is designed to be easily extensible with building support for some profile and debug options

You can trigger this by manually looking at it

Then you can get information from it quickly and do more things than mods like `The one probe.`    
We can get the information in a more interactive way

get the detailed item information that is stored just by your view

If you think the widget is too big or too small, you can adjust their sizes conveniently, just holding `alt` and scrolling your mouse,
Also, you can hold shift at the same time to adjust in a more precise way
